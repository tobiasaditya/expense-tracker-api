# expense-tracker-api

This repository used to learn how to build a REST API using Spring Boot Framework (Java) and SQL database (PostgreSQL). I also used JPA repository for database
operation.

This backend include
1. Register user
2. Login user
3. Authentication JWT token (simple)
4. CRUD category (Many to one relation with User)
5. CRUD transaction (Many to One relation with User AND Category)
6. Custom response handler
7. Validation input (only on update transaction)
